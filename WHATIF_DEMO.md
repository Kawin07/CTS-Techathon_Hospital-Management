### Demo Flow

1. **Access the What-If Analysis**

   - Navigate to Analytics ‚Üí What-If Analysis
   - View the enhanced AI assistant welcome message with formatting examples

2. **Test Pre-built Scenarios** (Recommended First Steps):

   - Click on **"Oxygen Supply Crisis"** scenario
   - Observe structured AI analysis with formatted sections
   - Note the **bold headers**, bullet points, and emoji organization
   - Test the copy-to-clipboard functionality

3. **Try Custom Queries**:

   - **Oxygen Scenarios**: "What if oxygen drops to 30% during peak hours?"
   - **Staffing Crisis**: "What if 40% of nurses are sick with flu?"
   - **Mass Casualty**: "What if 50 trauma patients arrive suddenly?"
   - **Infrastructure**: "What if we have a power outage for 6 hours?"
   - **Capacity Issues**: "What if ICU is at 95% and we get 10 critical patients?"

4. **Review Enhanced AI Responses**:

   - ‚úÖ **Structured formatting** with clear sections
   - ‚úÖ **Risk assessments** with severity levels (1-4)
   - ‚úÖ **Timeframed action plans** (0-15 min, 15min-4hr, 4hr+)
   - ‚úÖ **Quantified impacts** (efficiency scores, costs, timelines)
   - ‚úÖ **Prevention strategies** for future avoidance

5. **Test System Features**:
   - Export chat history to text file
   - Copy individual responses to clipboard
   - Clear chat and restart conversation
   - Try scenarios during potential API issues (fallback responses)

### Testing Network Issues

The system now gracefully handles connectivity problems:

1. **Scenario**: If you see "Analysis Error" (like in your screenshot)
2. **Response**: The system provides fallback analysis for common scenarios
3. **Benefit**: Hospital operations can continue with structured guidance even during API outages

### Expected AI Response Structure

The system now provides **structured, formatted responses** with proper markdown rendering:

```
üìä **Impact Summary**: Overview of scenario effects with clear formatting
‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Assessment**:
- **Severity**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW (Level X/4)
- **Probability**: Likelihood assessment
- **Duration**: Expected timeline for impact
- **Affected Areas**: Specific departments/systems

üéØ **Immediate Actions** (0-15 minutes):
- Bulleted action items with specific timeframes
- Clear priority ordering
- Responsible parties identified

üìã **Short-term Strategy** (15 minutes - 4 hours):
- Tactical responses with measurable outcomes
- Resource allocation adjustments
- Coordination requirements

üîÑ **Long-term Adjustments** (4+ hours):
- Strategic changes for sustained operations
- System improvements and upgrades
- Policy and procedure updates

üìà **Optimization Impact**:
- Efficiency score changes (from 91% baseline)
- Cost implications ($X,XXX estimates)
- Recovery timeline projections
- Performance metric impacts

üí° **Prevention Recommendations**:
- Proactive measures to avoid recurrence
- System upgrades and redundancies
- Training and protocol improvements
```

### New Features Added

1. **Enhanced Formatting**:

   - **Bold text** rendering with `**text**` syntax
   - Emoji headers with structured sections
   - Bullet points and numbered lists
   - Proper typography and spacing

2. **Improved Error Handling**:

   - Intelligent fallback responses for common scenarios
   - Network timeout handling (15-second timeout)
   - Rate limiting graceful degradation
   - Detailed error messages with troubleshooting steps

3. **Fallback Response System**:
   - Pre-built responses for oxygen crisis scenarios
   - Staff shortage analysis templates
   - Mass casualty response frameworks
   - Generic emergency protocols when API unavailable

### Key Benefits

1. **Intelligent Scenario Planning**

   - AI-driven analysis based on hospital context
   - Considers current resource levels and staff capacity
   - Provides actionable recommendations with timeframes

2. **Risk Assessment**

   - Probability and severity calculations
   - Cascade effect analysis
   - Patient safety prioritization

3. **Resource Optimization**

   - Staff reallocation suggestions
   - Equipment redistribution plans
   - Supply chain impact analysis

4. **Decision Support**
   - Evidence-based recommendations
   - Multiple response strategies
   - Performance metric predictions

### Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini Pro API
- **Service Architecture**: Modular GeminiService class
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback strategies
- **State Management**: React hooks with proper cleanup

### Usage Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Ask detailed questions for better analysis
2. **Use Context**: Reference current hospital status for accurate predictions
3. **Explore Scenarios**: Try various "what-if" combinations
4. **Review History**: Export chat for documentation and planning

### Sample Queries to Try

- "What if our main oxygen supply line fails during surgery?"
- "What if we need to evacuate 50 patients due to fire?"
- "What if a flu outbreak affects 60% of our staff?"
- "What if we receive 100 patients from a building collapse?"
- "What if our electronic health records system crashes?"

This system provides hospital administrators with AI-powered decision support for complex operational scenarios, enabling proactive planning and optimized resource management.
